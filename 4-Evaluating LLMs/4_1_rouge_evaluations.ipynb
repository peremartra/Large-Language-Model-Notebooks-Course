        "# How to Evaluate Large Language Models for Summarization Using ROUGE.\n",
        "The way we evaluate large language models is quite different from evaluating machine learning models, where metrics like Accuracy, F1 Score, or Recall were commonly used.\n",
        "\n",
        "Metrics for generated language are distinct. Depending on the specific application, different metrics are chosen to assess the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will explore the usage of the ROUGE metric to measure the quality of summaries generated by a language model.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is ROUGE?\n",
        "ROUGE isn't just a single metric; it's a set of metrics that measure the overlap and similarity between the generated summary and a reference summary that serves as a benchmark.\n",
        "\n",
        "It returns fourth individual metrics. The metrics provided are:\n",
        "\n",
        "* ROUGE-1: Measures the overlap of unigrams, or single words.\n",
        "* ROUGE-2: Measures the overlap of bigrams, or pairs of words.\n",
        "* ROUGE-L: Measures the longest common subsequence, rewarding longer shared sequences between the generated and reference summaries.\n",
        "* ROUGE-LSUM: Calculated as the length of the LCS divided by the sum of the lengths of the generated summary and the reference summary.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What are we going to do?\n",
        "We are going to use two T5 models, one of them being the t5-Base model and the other a t5-base fine-tuned  specifically designed for creating summaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, we will use a dataset and generate summaries using both models. By comparing the two generated summaries, we can observe whether the fine-tuning has been effective in producing different results. In other words, here we will only determine that the two models exhibit significant differences in summary generation, but we won't know which one might perform better.\n",
        "\n",
        "To determine which model generates better summaries, we will utilize a well-known dataset called 'cnn_dailymail,' which is available in the 'datasets' library.\n",
        "\n",
        "This dataset contains reference summaries that can be used for comparison. We will assess the summaries generated by the two models against these reference summaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model that obtains a higher ROUGE score will be considered the one that produces better summaries.\n",

Due to the expense of discovering molecules and the challenges of hand-labeling millions of structures, large training datasets are often hard to come by, which limits the effectiveness of machine-learning approaches.', 'By contrast, the system created by the MIT researchers can effectively predict molecular properties using only a small amount of data. Their system has an underlying understanding of the rules that dictate how building blocks combine to produce valid molecules. These rules capture the similarities between molecular structures, which helps the system generate new molecules and predict their properties in a data-efficient manner.', 'This method outperformed other machine-learning approaches on both small and large datasets, and was able to accurately predict molecular properties and generate viable molecules when given a dataset with fewer than 100 samples.', '\\u201cOur goal with this project is to use some data-driven methods to speed up the discovery of new molecules, so you can train a model to do the prediction without all of these cost-heavy experiments,\\u201d says lead author Minghao Guo, a computer science and electrical engineering (EECS) graduate student.', 'Guo\\u2019s co-authors include MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab research staff members Veronika Thost, Payel Das, and Jie Chen; recent MIT graduates Samuel Song \\u201923 and Adithya Balachandran \\u201923; and senior author Wojciech Matusik, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science and a member of the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, who leads the Computational Design and Fabrication Group within the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). The research will be presented at the International Conference for Machine Learning.', 'Learning the language of molecules', 'To achieve the best results with machine-learning models, scientists need training datasets with millions of molecules that have similar properties to those they hope to discover. In reality, these domain-specific datasets are usually very small. So, researchers use models that have been pretrained on large datasets of general molecules, which they apply to a much smaller, targeted dataset. However, because these models haven\\u2019t acquired much domain-specific knowledge, they tend to perform poorly.', 'The MIT team took a different approach. They created a machine-learning system that automatically learns the \\u201clanguage\\u201d of molecules \\u2014 what is known as a molecular grammar \\u2014 using only a small, domain-specific dataset. It uses this grammar to construct viable molecules and predict their properties.', 'In language theory, one generates words, sentences, or paragraphs based on a set of grammar rules. You can think of a molecular grammar the same way. It is a set of production rules that dictate how to generate molecules or polymers by combining atoms and substructures.', 'Just like a language grammar, which can generate a plethora of sentences using the same rules, one molecular grammar can represent a vast number of molecules. Molecules with similar structures use the same grammar production rules, and the system learns to understand these similarities.', 'Since structurally similar molecules often have similar properties, the system uses its underlying knowledge of molecular similarity to predict properties of new molecules more efficiently.', '\\u201cOnce we have this grammar as a representation for all the different molecules, we can use it to boost the process of property prediction,\\u201d Guo says.', 'The system learns the production rules for a molecular grammar using reinforcement learning \\u2014 a trial-and-error process where the model is rewarded for behavior that gets it closer to achieving a goal.', 'But because there could be billions of ways to combine atoms and substructures, the process to learn grammar production rules would be too computationally expensive for anything but the tiniest dataset.', 'The researchers decoupled the molecular grammar into two parts. The first part, called a metagrammar, is a general, widely applicable grammar they design manually and give the system at the outset. Then it only needs to learn a much smaller, molecule-specific grammar from the domain dataset. This hierarchical approach speeds up the learning process.', 'Big results, small datasets', 'In experiments, the researchers\\u2019 new system simultaneously generated viable molecules and polymers, and predicted their properties more accurately than several popular machine-learning approaches, even when the domain-specific datasets had only a few hundred samples. Some other methods also required a costly pretraining step that the new system avoids.', 'The technique was especially effective at predicting physical properties of polymers, such as the glass transition temperature, which is the temperature required for a material to transition from solid to liquid. Obtaining this information manually is often extremely costly because the experiments require extremely high temperatures and pressures.', 'To push their approach further, the researchers cut one training set down by more than half \\u2014 to just 94 samples. Their model still achieved results that were on par with methods trained using the entire dataset.', '\\u201cThis grammar-based representation is very powerful. And because the grammar itself is a very general representation, it can be deployed to different kinds of graph-form data. We are trying to identify other applications beyond chemistry or material science,\\u201d Guo says.', 'In the future, they also want to extend their current molecular grammar to include the 3D geometry of molecules and polymers, which is key to understanding the interactions between polymer chains. They are also developing an interface that would show a user the learned grammar production rules and solicit feedback to correct rules that may be wrong, boosting the accuracy of the system.', 'This work is funded, in part, by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab and its member company, Evonik.']\",\n          \"['Is it possible to build machine-learning models without machine-learning expertise?', 'Jim Collins, the Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering and Science in the Department of Biological Engineering at MIT and the life sciences faculty lead at the Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health (Jameel Clinic), along with a number of colleagues decided to tackle this problem when facing a similar conundrum.

BioAutoMATED is even able to help determine how much data is required to appropriately train the chosen model.', '\\\"Our tool explores models that are better-suited for smaller, sparser biological datasets as well as more complex neural networks,\\u201d Valeri says. This is an advantage for research groups with new data that may or may not be suited for a machine learning problem.', '\\\"Conducting novel and successful experiments at the intersection of biology and machine learning can cost a lot of money,\\u201d Soenksen explains. \\\"Currently, biology-centric labs need to invest in significant digital infrastructure and AI-ML trained human resources before they can even see if their ideas are poised to pan out. We want to lower these barriers for domain experts in biology.\\u201d With BioAutoMATED, researchers have the freedom to run initial experiments to assess if it\\u2019s worthwhile to hire a machine-learning expert to build a different model for further experimentation.', 'The open-source code is publicly available and, researchers emphasize, it is easy to run. \\u201cWhat we would love to see is for people to take our code, improve it, and collaborate with larger communities to make it a tool for all,\\u201d Soenksen says. \\u201cWe want to prime the biological research community and generate awareness related to AutoML techniques, as a seriously useful pathway that could merge rigorous biological practice with fast-paced AI-ML practice better than it is achieved today.\\u201d', \\\"Collins, the senior author on the paper, is also affiliated with the MIT Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology, the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and the Wyss Institute.

Today\\u2019s AI technology has artificial neural networks at its core, and most of the time we can trust these AI computer vision systems to see things the way we do \\u2014 but sometimes they falter. According to MIT and IBM research scientists, one way to improve computer vision is to instruct the artificial neural networks that they rely on to deliberately mimic the way the brain\\u2019s biological neural network processes visual images.', 'Researchers led by MIT Professor James DiCarlo, the director of MIT\\u2019s Quest for Intelligence and member of the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, have made a computer vision model more robust by training it to work like a part of the brain that humans and other primates rely on for object recognition. This May, at the International Conference on Learning Representations, the team reported that when they trained an artificial neural network using neural activity patterns in the brain\\u2019s inferior temporal (IT) cortex, the artificial neural network was more robustly able to identify objects in images than a model that lacked that neural training. And the model\\u2019s interpretations of images more closely matched what humans saw, even when images included minor distortions that made the task more difficult.', 'Comparing neural circuits', 'Many of the artificial neural networks used for computer vision already resemble the multilayered brain circuits that process visual information in humans and other primates. Like the brain, they use neuron-like units that work together to process information. As they are trained for a particular task, these layered components collectively and progressively process the visual information to complete the task \\u2014 determining, for example, that an image depicts a bear or a car or a tree.', 'DiCarlo and others previously found that when such deep-learning computer vision systems establish efficient ways to solve visual problems, they end up with artificial circuits that work similarly to the neural circuits that process visual information in our own brains. That is, they turn out to be surprisingly good scientific models of the neural mechanisms underlying primate and human vision.', 'That resemblance is helping neuroscientists deepen their understanding of the brain. By demonstrating ways visual information can be processed to make sense of images, computational models suggest hypotheses about how the brain might accomplish the same task. As developers continue to refine computer vision models, neuroscientists have found new ideas to explore in their own work.', '\\u201cAs vision systems get better at performing in the real world, some of them turn out to be more human-like in their internal processing. That\\u2019s useful from an understanding-biology point of view,\\u201d says DiCarlo, who is also a professor of brain and cognitive sciences and an investigator at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research.', 'Engineering a more brain-like AI', 'While their potential is promising, computer vision systems are not yet perfect models of human vision. DiCarlo suspected one way to improve computer vision may be to incorporate specific brain-like features into these models.', 'To test this idea, he and his collaborators built a computer vision model using neural data previously collected from vision-processing neurons in the monkey IT cortex \\u2014 a key part of the primate ventral visual pathway involved in the recognition of objects \\u2014 while the animals viewed various images. More specifically, Joel Dapello, a Harvard University graduate student and former MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab intern; and Kohitij Kar, assistant professor and Canada Research Chair (Visual Neuroscience) at York University and visiting scientist at MIT; in collaboration with David Cox, IBM Research\\u2019s vice president for AI models and IBM director of the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab; and other researchers at IBM Research and MIT asked an artificial neural network to emulate the behavior of these primate vision-processing neurons while the network learned to identify objects in a standard computer vision task.', '\\u201cIn effect, we said to the network, \\u2018please solve this standard computer vision task, but please also make the function of one of your inside simulated \\u201cneural\\u201d layers be as similar as possible to the function of the corresponding biological neural layer,\\u2019\\u201d DiCarlo explains. \\u201cWe asked it to do both of those things as best it could.\\u201d This forced the artificial neural circuits to find a different way to process visual information than the standard, computer vision approach, he says.', 'After training the artificial model with biological data, DiCarlo\\u2019s team compared its activity to a similarly-sized neural network model trained without neural data, using the standard approach for computer vision. They found that the new, biologically informed model IT layer was\\\\xa0\\u2014 as instructed \\u2014 a better match for IT neural data.\\\\xa0 That is, for every image tested, the population of artificial IT neurons in the model responded more similarly to the corresponding population of biological IT neurons.', 'The researchers also found that the model IT was also a better match to IT neural data collected from another monkey, even though the model had never seen data from that animal, and even when that comparison was evaluated on that monkey\\u2019s IT responses to new images. This indicated that the team\\u2019s new, \\u201cneurally aligned\\u201d computer model may be an improved model of the neurobiological function of the primate IT cortex \\u2014 an interesting finding, given that it was previously unknown whether the amount of neural data that can be currently collected from the primate visual system is capable of directly guiding model development.', 'With their new computer model in hand, the team asked whether the \\u201cIT neural alignment\\u201d procedure also leads to any changes in the overall behavioral performance of the model. Indeed, they found that the neurally-aligned model was more human-like in its behavior \\u2014 it tended to succeed in correctly categorizing objects in images for which humans also succeed, and it tended to fail when humans also fail.', 'Adversarial attacks', 'The team also found that the neurally aligned model was more resistant to \\u201cadversarial attacks\\u201d that developers use to test computer vision and AI systems. In computer vision, adversarial attacks introduce small distortions into images that are meant to mislead an artificial neural network.', '\\u201cSay that you have an image that the model identifies as a cat. Because you have the knowledge of the internal workings of the model, you can then design very small changes in the image so that the model suddenly thinks it\\u2019s no longer a cat,\\u201d DiCarlo explains.', 'These minor distortions don\\u2019t typically fool humans, but computer vision models struggle with these alterations. A person who looks at the subtly distorted cat still reliably and robustly reports that it\\u2019s a cat. But standard computer vision models are more likely to mistake the cat for a dog, or even a tree.', '\\u201cThere must be some internal differences in the way our brains process images that lead to our vision being more resistant to those kinds of attacks,\\u201d DiCarlo says. And indeed, the team found that when they made their model more neurally aligned, it became more robust, correctly identifying more images in the face of adversarial attacks. The model could still be fooled by stronger \\u201cattacks,\\u201d but so can people, DiCarlo says. His team is now exploring the limits of adversarial robustness in humans.', 'A few years ago, DiCarlo\\u2019s team found they could also improve a model\\u2019s resistance to adversarial attacks by designing the first layer of the artificial network to emulate the early visual processing layer in the brain. One key next step is to combine such approaches \\u2014 making new models that are simultaneously neurally aligned at multiple visual processing layers.', 'The new work is further evidence that an exchange of ideas between neuroscience and computer science can drive progress in both fields. \\u201cEverybody gets something out of the exciting virtuous cycle between natural/biological intelligence and artificial intelligence,\\u201d DiCarlo says. \\u201cIn this case, computer vision and AI researchers get new ways to achieve robustness, and neuroscientists and cognitive scientists get more accurate mechanistic models of human vision.\\u201d', 'This work was supported by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, Semiconductor Research Corporation, the U.S. Defense Research Projects Agency, the MIT Shoemaker Fellowship, U.S. Office of Naval Research, the Simons Foundation, and Canada Research Chair Program.']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://news.mit.edu/2023/learning-language-molecules-predict-properties-0707\",\n          \"https://news.mit.edu/2023/bioautomated-open-source-machine-learning-platform-for-research-labs-0706\",\n          \"https://news.mit.edu/2023/when-computer-vision-works-like-human-brain-0630\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
