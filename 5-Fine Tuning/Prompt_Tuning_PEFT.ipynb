        "A short sample of models available to be trained with PEFT are: Bloom, Llama, GPT-J, GPT-2, BERT... and more. Hugging Face is working hard to bring more Models to the Library.\n",

        "## Brief introduction to Prompt Tuning.\n",
        "Prompt Tuning, or Soft Prompt, is an Additive training Technique. We don't modify the weights of the model, instead we modify the weights of the prompt. To achieve that, we must add some new values to the prompt, and these values are trained. We only modify the weights of the new values in the layers containing the prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can modify the behavior of a model by just updating 0.0005% of their weights. Achieving a similar result to other techniques where we update the weights of the model.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The training is Faster and Cheaper. And not only that, we can train different models and in inference time, we just need to load one foundational model, together with the new small trained models because the weights of the original have not been modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "## what are we going to do in the notebook\n",
        "We are going to train two different models using two datasets and just one Pre Trained model from the Bloom family. A model will be trained with a Dataset of prompts and the other with a Dataset of inspirational sentences. We will compare the results to the same question of the models before and after training.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will see how we can load both models having just one copy of the foundational Model in Memory.\n"
