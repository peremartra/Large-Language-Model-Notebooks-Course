        "In contrast, the impact on the Lambada test has been remarkable, with a drop in accuracy of over 50%.\n",

        "\n",
        "We’ve managed to reduce the model’s size while, at least initially, preserving much of its functionality, depending on the % pruned and the task demanded to the model.\n",

        "We should explore other forms of structured pruning, such as removing entire layers, as well as different ways to determine which elements are pruned from the model. One such method is Activation-Based Pruning, where neuron activations are evaluated using a specific dataset, and those with low activation are removed.\n"
